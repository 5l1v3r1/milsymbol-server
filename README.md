## Milsymbol in Node.js

This is an example of how you can create a minimal military symbol server using
Node.js and milsymbol.

_You should not run this server in a production environment without adding error
handling and input checks._

To start the server, navigate to this folder in a terminal and run:

```
node index.js
```

When the server is up and running, you can try it out by navigating to:

http://127.0.0.1:3000/?sidc=SFG-UCI----D&size=50

_You can add any milsymbol options to the query string_
